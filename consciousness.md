## Life Hacks 
The best habit I have got into is having a pint of water next to my bed. So when my alarm wakes me up I have to finish the glass.
  -One of the reasons people feel tired and lethargic in the morning is that they're dehydrated. Chances are you haven't drunk anything for 9 or 10+ hours. Look at the colour of your urine when you first pee in the morning, very rarely is it clear.
  
Dark chocolate helps with public speaking. -Gabe Jagoe-Seidl

When studying for an exam or test, wear a perfume/cologne you've never used before. When the day of the test comes, use the perfume/cologne again. The scent will trigger your memory.

Or you could learn to find fulfillment in both work and play. There's nothing wrong with spending some of your time doing nothing. And there's plenty wrong with spending all of your time working.Both people have the exact same problem in this comic. They're miserable for part of their day because they don't value the experience for itself. They are dissatisfied while they work because they only value the outcome (look what I made), not the experience. They are dissatisfied after they play because they only value the outcome (I did nothing), not the experience.

This isn't a good outlook. It's not even two sides of the same coin - it's the exact same toxic thought process in two situations. If you only value yourself when you have actively produced something and at no other time, you basically guarantee that your self worth is directly tied to your ability to output stuff. You don't value your experiences, you don't value gained knowledge, you don't value time simply spent enjoying yourself - All you value is the physical product of your work. Your time isn't valuable because it outputs fucking products. **Your time is valuable because you have a limited amount of it** and you should have experiences, enjoy yourself, and make the world better for other people. Sitting on the couch watching TV is exactly as valuable as you allow yourself to make it. You can use it as an avoidance tool and it sucks, or you can use it as a way to decompress, process your day, and to simply enjoy some time spent not having to entertain or focus yourself. The problem isn't the activity. **The problem is that you've built a world for yourself where you think your finished goods output determines your value as a human being.** Comics like this, and a huge chunk of the 'motivation' posted in this subreddit, reinforce that world view.

1. Improve your public speaking skills: And this is different from perfecting English (or the language of your choice). This is about sounding confident, being expressive and understanding the subtle art of conversation. Ever tried a group discussion ? Go for some. They teach you how to channelize conversations the way you want, take control and shape the thoughts of a group.
2. Do Creative Stuff: Very important. This is the time you are not burdened with exams, or assignments. Take time out and build stuff. With your hands (paint, best out of waste), with your pen (stories, a crazy blog, anything), or on your computer (Photoshop, Web Design etc). These may sound silly, but stuff gets exciting when you add step 4 to it.
3. ASK QUESTIONS: About anything, and everything. Politics, history, religion, environment, culture... anything you read about online or in the newspaper. Go deep. Understand world conflicts, understand perspectives. Build an informed opinion (THIS will help you in every interview you EVER sit for.)
4. And oh, when you add irrepressible curiosity to creativity, you walk the lines of EVERY great individual who ever did great stuff. Anyone. You name it, they've done it.


## Motivation 

The most dangerous thing you can do is play it safe. 

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

Motivation is bullshit, it comes and goes. Discipline is what will inspire you.

"The whole idea of motivation is a trap. Forget motivation. Just do it. Exercise, lose weight, test your blood sugar, or whatever. And then, guess what? After you start doing the thing, that’s when motivation comes and makes it easy for you to keep on doing it.” -John Maxwell

“The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible.” -Arthur C. Clarke

"Be not afraid of growing slowly. Be afraid of standing still.” -Chinese Proverb      

Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men. - Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe

“He would say that when your mind is telling you you’re done, you’re really only 40 percent done. And he had a motto: If it doesn’t suck we don’t do it. And that was his way of forcing us to get uncomfortable to figure out what our baseline was and what our comfort level was and just turning it upside-down.” [Living with a Seal](https://www.amazon.com/Living-SEAL-Training-Toughest-Planet/dp/B0176MAG1M)

### Overcoming Failure
“If you’re afraid to fail, you’re probably going to fail.”-Kobe Bryant

### Feeling Lost 

‘When you feel homesick,’ he said, ‘just look up. Because the moon is the same wherever you go.’

Bad day, not a bad life. There is always some good in a bad day.

“Experience does for the soul, what education does for the mind”-Casey Neistat

## Intriguing Notions/Beliefs

“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.” “A stereotyped but unconscious despair
is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind.”

"We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others, that in the end, we become disguised to
ourselves."—FRANÇOIS DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD

"People hate to think about bad things happening, so they always underestimate their likelihood”- The Big Short

I think therefore I am -Rene Descartes 

## Enjoy Life 

## Personal Experiences 

People tend to overestimate how much they can do in one year, but underestimate what they can do in four years. 

A bit of sincerity and genuiness go a long way. 

Set two new goals each quarter. -[Vincent Yang](vincentyang.me) 

20% of the inputs produce 80% of the outputs -Zipf Mystery   

Don't climb the mountain to get to the top. Climb the mountain to climb the mountain.

Comfort in Uncomfort

Fitness as a form of escapism 

“Don’t be a stranger.”

With each success should come a bigger more ambitious goal 

There is not one specific meaning in life. You constantly redefine and find meaning through the experiences you undertake in life.

"Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.” -Tyrion Lannister
