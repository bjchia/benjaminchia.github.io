## Life Tips
The best habit I have got into is having a pint of water next to my bed. So when my alarm wakes me up I have to finish the glass.
  - One of the reasons people feel tired and lethargic in the morning is that they're dehydrated. Chances are you haven't drunk anything for 9 or 10+ hours. Look at the colour of your urine when you first pee in the morning, very rarely is it clear.

The reason why it's so hard, is because our human thinking is biased towards the negative. When we're faced with a choice, it's more likely we're considering the negatives then the positives of making a change. This is also called "risk aversion".
  - A classic fallacy that comes from risk aversion is "sunk cost". The more time and effort we put in a project, the less likely we are to pull out because we don't want to lose our investment.
 
Going into a situation thinking you're doing just for the experience takes a lot of the pressure off, too, and helps get positive results.

"If you don't ask, the answer is always no."

The failure is just not trying.

“A last important trick is to reframe your focus. One student, for example, is able to get himself up at four thirty each weekday morning, not by thinking about how tired he is when he wakes but about how good breakfast will be.”

“The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself”

When studying for an exam or test, wear a perfume/cologne you've never used before. When the day of the test comes, use the perfume/cologne again. The scent will trigger your memory.


### Feeling Lost 

“Every day it gets a little easier, but that’s the hard part. But it does get easier” -Bojack Horseman 

‘When you feel homesick,’ he said, ‘just look up. Because the moon is the same wherever you go.’

Bad day, not a bad life. There is always some good in a bad day.

“Experience does for the soul, what education does for the mind.”-Casey Neistat

"I'm not where I want to be" to "I'm in the process of getting to where I want to be.”

"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that's been given to us" - Gandalf.

“Every time I took these bigger risks, the opportunity for a bigger payout was always there.” 

“If you don’t like what’s happening, you can’t just sit there and complain.” 

“It doesn’t matter where you go,” he wrote. “It matters more what you do when you get there. Just go there and work.”

What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong.

The wind gets stronger the closer you get to the mountain top.

“Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow”. 

## Intriguing Notions/Beliefs

“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.” “A stereotyped but unconscious despair
is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind.”

"We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others, that in the end, we become disguised to
ourselves."—FRANÇOIS DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD

"People hate to think about bad things happening, so they always underestimate their likelihood”- The Big Short

I think therefore I am -Rene Descartes 

We weren't supposed to win we were supposed to always keep struggling for the unattainable.

## Personal Experiences 

People tend to overestimate how much they can do in one year, but underestimate what they can do in four years. 

A bit of sincerity and genuiness go a long way. 

Set two new goals each quarter. -[Vincent Yang](vincentyang.me) 

20% of the inputs produce 80% of the outputs -Zipf Mystery   

Don't climb the mountain to get to the top. Climb the mountain to climb the mountain.

Comfort in Uncomfort

Fitness as a form of escapism 

“Don’t be a stranger.”

With each success should come a bigger more ambitious goal 

There is not one specific meaning in life. You constantly redefine and find meaning through the experiences you undertake in life. 



The man makes the name, not vice versa.

**Your time is valuable because you have a limited amount of it** 
**The problem is that you've built a world for yourself where you think your finished goods output determines your value as a human being.** 

1. Improve your public speaking skills: And this is different from perfecting English (or the language of your choice). This is about sounding confident, being expressive and understanding the subtle art of conversation. Ever tried a group discussion ? Go for some. They teach you how to channelize conversations the way you want, take control and shape the thoughts of a group.
2. Do Creative Stuff: Very important. This is the time you are not burdened with exams, or assignments. Take time out and build stuff. With your hands (paint, best out of waste), with your pen (stories, a crazy blog, anything), or on your computer (Photoshop, Web Design etc). These may sound silly, but stuff gets exciting when you add step 4 to it.
3. ASK QUESTIONS: About anything, and everything. Politics, history, religion, environment, culture... anything you read about online or in the newspaper. Go deep. Understand world conflicts, understand perspectives. Build an informed opinion (THIS will help you in every interview you EVER sit for.)
4. And oh, when you add irrepressible curiosity to creativity, you walk the lines of EVERY great individual who ever did great stuff. Anyone. You name it, they've done it.

## Cultural Shifts

“ It occurred to me that this shift might symbolize a shift in culture, a shift from a culture of self-effacement that says “Nobody’s better than me, but I’m no better than anyone else” to a culture of self-promotion that says “Recognize my accomplishments, I’m pretty special.”

“In its most complete meaning, intellectual humility is accurate self-awareness from a distance."

What's the use of surviving if we become just as bad as them?"

## Miscellaneous 

"Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.” -Tyrion Lannister
