## Habits 
At the end of the day, how long it takes to form a particular habit doesnâ€™t really matter that much. Whether it takes 50 days or 500 days, you have to put in the work either way. The only way to get to Day 500 is to start with Day 1. So forget about the number and focus on doing the work.


College is your time to explore. Make sure you are continually taking the time to try new things. -Micah Marmorstein 

Do the scary thing first then be afraid
