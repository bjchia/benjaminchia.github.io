> At the end of the day, how long it takes to form a particular habit doesn’t really matter that much. Whether it takes 50 days or 500 days, you have to put in the work either way. The only way to get to Day 500 is to start with Day 1. So forget about the number and focus on doing the work.

## Habits 
* [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

### Framing The Right Mindset 

* Think like a Child, don't think like a Caveman.
	-This is how Da Vinci accomplished what he accomplished, he thought like a child and he got better out of your own child like curiosity and wonderment. He talks about it in his Codex's (do recommend). Or was that Ben Franklin's Autobiography (also recommend) where I read that, I'm not sure, one of the two, maybe both, but in general this is how the Polymath becomes good at things.
