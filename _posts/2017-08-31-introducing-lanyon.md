title: Introducing Brain Flow
---

In high school, I always felt very "scatterbrained," trying to make sense of all of my commitments. At one moment I could be thinking of my homework tasks, another moment perhaps thinking about future goals, what song I had just heard on the radio, and then questioning my entire existence.

I've realized since that while I do tend to get lost in thoughts, I can achor these thoughts on paper (hence myself in reality) and make sure I don't forget my once epheremal thoughts. I'm not sure if I would call this blog, since it's not neccesarily about personal feelings. **Brainflow is about everything and anything I find interesting.** 

Brain Flow first started as a note within my notes app on my Macbook Pro a couple months before college started (circa mid-2016). [Stream of Consciousness](https://bjchia.github.io/quotes.html) was where I would place all of my intriguing thoughts. I then expanded Brainflow into an ordered folder with the tabs that you see hidden within the drawer on the left. 

My intentions for expanding Brainflow into an extension of my personal website are to test my programming abilities (learning Jekyll, Git's Interface) while also hoping to give back to the prospective reader. Hopefully this ordered chaos will give you some help/advice on topics I have been exploring!
