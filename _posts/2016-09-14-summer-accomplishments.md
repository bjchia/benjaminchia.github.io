title: Summer 2017 Accomplishments 
---

As summer winds down with less than two weeks until school starts again, I think it's necessary for me to reflect on what I wanted to accomplish this summer, and what I actually DID accomplish. I'm often pretty hard on myself, and this post is a way for me to pat myself on the back and inspire a bit of self-love. 

What I wanted to accomplish: 
1) Learn how to Box 
2) Cardio/Weights
3) Learn how to Meal Prep
4) Improve Financial Literacy
5) Read books
6) Balance internship while doing well in MAT 22A 
7) Learn Piano

What I ACTUALLY accomplished: 

1) I didn't learn how to box, but I can use the speedbag pretty well now! My form and pace with the speedbag is a lot better than when it started.

2) You worked out like crazy. At the bare minimum 6 days of working out each week, sometimes mixing in double workouts with weights then a form of high intensity cardio.

3) You can cook in a cost-efficient manner! All you've been eating is chicken, broccoli, and rice, but now you've moved onto ground turkey and green beans. 

4) You read Rich Dad Poor Dad, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, absorbed tons of financial education from dad. I'd say you went above and beyond with this goal. You also started investing with Vanguard ETF's/Paypal (Medium Risk) and opened two credit card.

5) Mainly financial literacy books, but you also read *The Goldfinch*. Keep on reading during the school year! 

6) You improved on your study habits that broke down when entering college! Try to maintain a structured, 24 hour guideline and do well during fall quarter. Also you're working as an intern, learning new skills, and making a net profit in bank account.

7) Nope. Well, you have been learning songs from La-La Land, but more practice! I'd say I accomplished 3% of this goal.

8) Started searching for a lot internships, made an internship spreadsheet, and have been sending out emails to network at shoe companies (1 year goal: intern at shoe company or Fortune 500, backup is study abroad engineering research in Japan) 

9) FINISHED website. Main page is up and running, learned CSS and JS, know how to use git through computer, and brainflow is working. Need to revise the portfolio section (check advice from Jennifer Ching).

All in all, you've worked hard. I know you like to keep your head down and constantly keep working, but be proud of what you've done in a 12 week span as of this date.
