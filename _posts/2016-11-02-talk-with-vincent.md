title: A Conversation With Vincent 
---


I had a conversation with Vincent Yang this past week. Here are some key take-aways from that talk: 

## Culture 

In our conversation about pursuing different career paths and companies to work for, he emphasized the importance of workplace culture. 


Talk with Vincent: 

Hasseeb Person

Culture, what you do in your job, why’d you pick that job

why does culture matter? 
	- 

to figure out actual culture, talk to people who left 


what is something you don’t like working there? 

apple is about collaboration, stealing ideas and refurbishing those any 

2% rule still applies, pdf matching 


friends of friends, friends of siblings, referrals got vincent into his internships 

spending time on projects instead, branch that into something 

here’s everyone, everyone who will cold-email someone, someone who has done a relevant project 

Example: project management: 
1. full write-up catered to a product 
2. pass a full rounds if you’ve put that much work into it 

In order to network your way in: 
1. message your way in
2. do what they want, and do it better than all of the other people interviewing 


Networking and branching into technical fields:
1. network in and also show hey, i’ve done this 

Professors with research:
1. research is often times just professors saying “hey, i want to do this project” 
2. example: make the assignments for cryptocurrency class 
3. Letter of rec. and also professor’s network 


Email and call people instead of going to career fairs, 

finding different avenues to get in:
1. whoishiring.io
2. hackernews.com 

NIKE: 

ask people there what stands out to them 
equivalent of this is next level 

taking you opposed to people at ivy leaguess

name is still highly relevant: 

point out specific reasons why you can get paid more

first job out of college 

business and management for what school you went to 

subreddit 

r/fire 

start-ups: 
1. make a start-up right now 
2. whole another network of start-up in davis, still decent and can still network way into
