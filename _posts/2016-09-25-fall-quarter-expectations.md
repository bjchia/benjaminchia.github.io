title: Tempering Expectations & Reality 
---

School is starting in exactly two days. If I were to characterize my feelings right now, it'd be a mix of a lot of **nervousness** and **excitement**. 

I don't like to verbalize how I'm feeling, but it doesn't seem like a bad idea to write it out. It's been pretty thereapeutic since I transitioned brainflow to a full on website. 

Let's break it down: 

1. **Nervousness.** This quarter I'm focusing solely on my major-related classes with the intent to finish all of my mechanical engineering classes by the end of junior year. I'll be taking ENG 45, ENG 35, PHY 9B, and MAT 22B while working 18.5 hours. YIKES. That is worrisome. I have to be extremely diligent about how I structure my hours, making sure that each part of my day is used as efficiently as possible. 

2. **Excitement.** This quarter I'm really pushing myself. Yes, I've endured the slaughter of which is pledging for TT and the brutality of a twenty unit final's schedule (MAKE SURE TO PLAN FINALS SMARTLY), but this quarter is when I finally get to take more major related classes! No more GE's (for now) albeit they were interesting and filler lower-div classes. I think working as an ICC advisor will be very interesting work, and continuing to intern at Regional San will provide a bit of continuity from summer that I so dearly enjoyed. 

Remember to temper your expectations. I consciously recognize that I have a tendency to visualize the best possible outcomes, not thinking about worst case scenarios that can happen and which have happened in the past. Human nature tends to fall toward the optimistic spectrum of things, and I don't want you to disillusion yourself.

To make this quarter work realistically and to meet your goals, you're going to have to make sacrifices. Less social time and try to cut down on distractions.

Tips to keep in mind.
1. Pomodoros Technique (studying)
2. SLEEP ON TIME
3. Try to structure each day the same
4. Get your workout in (preferably 5 days/week) to reduce stress and increase endorphin flow) 

From past Benji to future Benji, I am supporting you! **Do the scary thing first, then be afraid.**
