title: Snap Into Focus
---

Post CalHacks, you've been slumping. All honestly, you've been sleeping through your feelings, neglecting homework, and not actively paying attention in lecture. I'm telling you now because it's not going to get easier as the quarter progresses, but snap back into reality. 

A part of you desperately wants to be included, to enjoy the camaraderie of friends and enjoy college. This part fears loneliness. Missing out on what you've defined as a quintessential college experience. 

But, there's another part of you that for the vast majority of your life, has tended to win out. A part of you wants to, and needs to be isolated. 

Stop seeking external sources for meaning in your life. Stop using sleep as a way to escape reality. Stop trying to break the habits YOU built so meticulously over the summer.

Reality gives nothing back so don't expext anything. 

For the sake of yourr health and you, WAKE UP.
