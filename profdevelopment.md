## Interviewing 
Near the end of the interview, when you are asked if you have any questions, don’t ask a question. **Instead, pitch a big strategic idea for whatever company you are interviewing for.** This is the single easiest way to be the most memorable candidate and get the job offer. 

Why? Because you effectively turned the portion of the interview that is supposed to have the most value for you personally into the part that has the most value for the company that’s considering hiring you.
