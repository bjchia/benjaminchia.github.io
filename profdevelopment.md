## Recruiting Advice

1) The best people are happily employed and designing great things, not actively looking for work and 2) Good people know good people. Referrals are golden!

## Interviewing 
Near the end of the interview, when you are asked if you have any questions, don’t ask a question. **Instead, pitch a big strategic idea for whatever company you are interviewing for.** This is the single easiest way to be the most memorable candidate and get the job offer. 

Why? Because you effectively turned the portion of the interview that is supposed to have the most value for you personally into the part that has the most value for the company that’s considering hiring you. 

### Basic Questions 

* [Basic Questions and Responses](https://imgur.com/QKWTId3?r)
### Questions to Ask 
* How would you describe the general culture of the company and the workplace?
* Why did you choose this company?
* What are some of the biggest challenges/successes currently facing the department?
* What projects would I be working on?
* Where do you see this company heading in upcoming years?

### Networking
* Every conversation should lead to at least one more contact.

### Meet-Ups During The Summer

* hroughout the summer, start-ups and larger companies consistently had fun events for general Bay Area interns. Throughout the summer, I either went or heard about events at Facebook, Stripe, Color, Yelp, Twitter, Bump, LikeALittle, LinkedIn, Mozilla, Twilio, Quora and Dropbox.  Several companies (LinkedIn, Mozilla, Stripe, Quora) held intern hackathons that (from what I hear) were a bunch of fun. 

* How do I hear about one of these?  Keep your head up and follow the list-servs above. If there's a particular company that you are interested in, email the recruiter, introduce yourself as an intern at X this summer and mention that you'd love to check the company out/be notified of any such events. Assertiveness is impressive. From my experience, approaches like this tend to work.
