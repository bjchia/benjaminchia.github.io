"The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them."

During the beginning of the summer of 2017, I became highly intrigued with financial education and literacy. As a current college student, I wanted to have a good grasp over my finances and to maintain a steady source of income. A book I highly recommend (recommended to me by a fellow mentor) is called [*Rich Dad Poor Dad*](http://www.lequydonhanoi.edu.vn/upload_images/S%C3%A1ch%20ngo%E1%BA%A1i%20ng%E1%BB%AF/Rich%20Dad%20Poor%20Dad.pdf) by Robert Kiyosaki. Invest in your education outside traditional academia!

To-Do/To-Read List:

* *The Intelligient Investor* by Benjamin Graham
* Robinhood Stock Trading 
* Mutual Funds, Trusts (Take 1/3 of bank account and invest here)<br>

## Advice to college students
* Make sure to track your expenses. Whenever I spend any form of money, I take note of it within my notes app (transitioning to spreadsheet). You'll be able to deduce what you're spending your money on and break down your expenses. 
* Meal Prep. Buying in bulk saves you so much money. If a typical meal from restaurant costs $8-10, I can meal prep roughly 10 meals of chicken, rice, and broccoli for the same price. 
* Don't spend impulsively. Before you buy something, wait anywhere from a day to a week to see if you still want it. 
* Make money work for you by applying to scholarships (note to self: start applying by fall quarter).

### Key Points from Rich Dad Poor Dad 

* You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. 
* An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is. 
* The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements. 
* Financial struggle is often the result of people working all their lives for someone else. 
* To become financially secure, a person needs to **mind their own business**. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your income column. 
* Know the difference between your profession and your OWN business. 

#### Assets 
1. *Businesses that do not require my presence* I own them, but they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it’s not a business. It becomes my job. 
2. Stocks 
3. Bonds 
4. Income-generating real estate 
5. Notes (IOUs) 
6. Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents 
7. Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market 

> I recognized that it was excessive fear and self-doubt that were the greatest detractors of personal genius. It broke my heart to see students know the answers, yet lack the courage to act on the answer. Often in the real world, it’s not the smart who get ahead, but the bold. 

#### Financial Intelligience 
* Accounting: Accounting is financial literacy, or the ability to read numbers. is is a vital skill if you want to build businesses or investments. 
* Investing: The science of money making money.
* Investors who create investments: 
  - Find opportunities that others missed
  - Raise money
  - Organize smart people
* The main management skills needed for success are: 
  - Management of cash flow 
  - Management of systems 
  - Management of people 
  
> “If you want something, you first need to give.”
>> Money is only an idea. If you want more money, simply change your thinking. Every self-made person started small with an idea, and then turned it into something big. e same applies to investing. It takes only a few dollars to start and grow it into something big. I meet so many people who spend their lives chasing the big deal, or trying to amass a lot of money to get into a big deal, but to me that is foolish. Too often I have seen unsophisticated investors put their large nest egg into one deal and lose most of it rapidly. They may have been good workers, but they were not good investors.
