"The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them." 
</p>

During the beginning of the summer of 2017, I became highly intrigued with financial education and literacy. As a current college student, I wanted to have a good grasp over my finances and to maintain a steady source of income. A book I highly recommend (recommended to me by a fellow mentor) is called [*Rich Dad Poor Dad*](http://www.lequydonhanoi.edu.vn/upload_images/S%C3%A1ch%20ngo%E1%BA%A1i%20ng%E1%BB%AF/Rich%20Dad%20Poor%20Dad.pdf) by Robert Kiyosaki. Invest in your education outside traditional academia!<br> 

To-Do/To-Read List:

* *The Intelligient Investor* by Benjamin Graham
* Robinhood Stock Trading 
* Mutual Funds, Trusts (Take 1/3 of bank account and invest here) 
  
## Advice to college students
* Make sure to track your expenses. Whenever I spend any form of money, I take note of it within my notes app (transitioning to spreadsheet). You'll be able to deduce what you're spending your money on and break down your expenses. 
* Meal Prep. Buying in bulk saves you so much money. If a typical meal from restaurant costs $8-10, I can meal prep roughly 10 meals of chicken, rice, and broccoli for the same price. 
* Don't spend impulsively. Before you buy something, wait anywhere from a day to a week to see if you still want it. 
* Make money work for you by applying to scholarships (note to self: start applying by fall quarter).
