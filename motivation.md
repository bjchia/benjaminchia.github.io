## Motivation 

“No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.” -Buddha

“It is not about the cards you are dealt, but how you play the hand.” - Randy Pausch, The Last Lecture

Work until your idols become your peers

There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man. True nobility is being noble to your former self.

The most dangerous thing you can do is play it safe. 

Rejection is a part of life, and not everyone has to like everyone. I should be more like my parents. More trials. More tribulations.  More blood, sweat, and tears. 

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

Motivation is bullshit, it comes and goes. Discipline is what will inspire you.

"The whole idea of motivation is a trap. Forget motivation. Just do it. Exercise, lose weight, test your blood sugar, or whatever. And then, guess what? After you start doing the thing, that’s when motivation comes and makes it easy for you to keep on doing it.” -John Maxwell

The older you are, the harder you have to work

Embracing your fears to turn that into the biggest gift in your 

“The heart cannot be taught in a classroom intellectually, to students mechanically taking notes…. Good, wise hearts are obtained through lifetimes of diligent effort to dig deeply within and heal lifetimes of scars…. You can’t teach it or email it or tweet it. It has to be discovered within the depths of one’s own heart when a person is finally ready to go looking for it, and not before.”

### Overcoming Failure
“If you’re afraid to fail, you’re probably going to fail.”-Kobe Bryant

“The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible.” -Arthur C. Clarke

Because the strong man who has known power all his life, may lose respect for that power, but a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.

"Be not afraid of growing slowly. Be afraid of standing still.” -Chinese Proverb      

Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men. - Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe

“He would say that when your mind is telling you you’re done, you’re really only 40 percent done. And he had a motto: If it doesn’t suck we don’t do it. And that was his way of forcing us to get uncomfortable to figure out what our baseline was and what our comfort level was and just turning it upside-down.” [Living with a Seal](https://www.amazon.com/Living-SEAL-Training-Toughest-Planet/dp/B0176MAG1M)

And we don't have to be those people to learn about rejection, and in my case, rejection was my curse, was my boogeyman. It has bothered me my whole life because I was running away from it. Then I started embracing it. I turned that into the biggest gift in my life.
Struggle forces us to move when we would otherwise stand still.
