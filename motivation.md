## Motivation 

The most dangerous thing you can do is play it safe. 

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

Motivation is bullshit, it comes and goes. Discipline is what will inspire you.

"The whole idea of motivation is a trap. Forget motivation. Just do it. Exercise, lose weight, test your blood sugar, or whatever. And then, guess what? After you start doing the thing, that’s when motivation comes and makes it easy for you to keep on doing it.” -John Maxwell

### Overcoming Failure
“If you’re afraid to fail, you’re probably going to fail.”-Kobe Bryant

“The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible.” -Arthur C. Clarke

"Be not afraid of growing slowly. Be afraid of standing still.” -Chinese Proverb      

Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men. - Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe

“He would say that when your mind is telling you you’re done, you’re really only 40 percent done. And he had a motto: If it doesn’t suck we don’t do it. And that was his way of forcing us to get uncomfortable to figure out what our baseline was and what our comfort level was and just turning it upside-down.” [Living with a Seal](https://www.amazon.com/Living-SEAL-Training-Toughest-Planet/dp/B0176MAG1M)
