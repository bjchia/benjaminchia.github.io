[Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#/media/File:Transistor_Count_and_Moore%27s_Law_-_2011.svg): Observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. 
  - Growth rate should slow by 2025. Perhaps this is why I don't see why smartphones are making as big of exponential gains in the recent years, processing strength can only grow so much when transistor count is reaching its finite limit.
  - Leads to advance of quantum computing?
