### Interviewing Tactics: 
* Who Am I: Purpose Driven, Soulful
  - Who I am as a person to why I'm interviewing now
* **Hone in on first Impression**
* Beginning, Middle, and End 
  - First came to UC Davis not entirely sure what to do, after joining different organizations, found I was most passionate about mechanical engineering (industrial design/mechatronics)

### Industrial Design/Engineering
* Portfolio that demonstrates and desplats your abilities to: 
  - Look at a problem
  - Come up with a solution
  - Sketch Your Ideas 
* Critical to sketch ideas (prior to prototyping) with specific/intentional design features 
* If you are able to document and capture your skills and abilities in photos, it will really demonstrate your abilities 
* Inspiration Portfolios'

### General Advice 
1. Stay flexible in your career choices and always keep your eyes out for opportunities. You never know what new things you can learn and adventures will come from it. Following your passion is equally valuable. Working should be fun and engaging. Getting a position that aligns with your interests makes you a more valuable and high-performing employee.
 
2. I would also advise you to do well at school (of course), but work experience matters a lot too. If you want to be a footwear engineer then coming into the industry knowing how to make shoes as well as how to apply science to the manufacturing processes will give you a leg up against the competition. Up until recently, most product engineers learn shoemaking on the job and donâ€™t necessarily have an engineering degree. A few went to shoe school to get formal vocational training.
 
3. Today it is becoming more important that new ftwr. engineers have a formal engineering education, a good grasp of fundamental engineering concepts and critical thinking/problem solving skills. Automation systems and new engineered materials are being used in shoe manufacturing. Understanding how adv. tech compliments and enhances traditional shoe making methods is key.

4.  Stay current on industry trends (particularly materials) and be ready to be informed enough to invent.  
5.  Become digitally savvy (CAD, Adobe, Computational design, FEA)
