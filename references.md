* GoogleX: Vision bridges problem to solution
  - Not all visions or ideas will be successful 
  - Principles: Happy challenge embrace (embrace failure) 
* Documentation is worth a thousand words  
* Leaders sell their vision
  - Instead of people checking out, why are people checking out? Setting the norm 
  - Find a financial mentor, life coach, career mentor 
* **If you don’t enjoy the roller coaster ride down, you’re not going to be able to get back up**
* Don’t create technology just to create technology, identify the problem. Understand the user experience in using the technology. 
* It’s not where you work, it what you do at work 
* Never solve problems at your desk 
* Why autonomous vehicles? Not just implications on transportation. Design of spaces, land, jobs. Disruption of multiple industries.
  - Looking for technology that disrupts current practices

* Portfolio that demonstrates and displays your abilities to: 
  - Look at a problem
  - Come up with a solution
  - Sketch Your Ideas 
* Critical to sketch ideas (prior to prototyping) with specific/intentional design features 
* If you are able to document and capture your skills and abilities in photos, it will really demonstrate your abilities 
* Inspiration Portfolios'

## [JP Spampinato: General Advice-Nike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jp-spampinato-7788665/)

1. Stay flexible in your career choices and always keep your eyes out for opportunities. You never know what new things you can learn and adventures will come from it. Following your passion is equally valuable. Working should be fun and engaging. Getting a position that aligns with your interests makes you a more valuable and high-performing employee.
 
2. I would also advise you to do well at school (of course), but work experience matters a lot too. If you want to be a footwear engineer then coming into the industry knowing how to make shoes as well as how to apply science to the manufacturing processes will give you a leg up against the competition. Up until recently, most product engineers learn shoemaking on the job and don’t necessarily have an engineering degree. A few went to shoe school to get formal vocational training.
 
3. Today it is becoming more important that new ftwr. engineers have a formal engineering education, a good grasp of fundamental engineering concepts and critical thinking/problem solving skills. Automation systems and new engineered materials are being used in shoe manufacturing. Understanding how adv. tech compliments and enhances traditional shoe making methods is key.

4.  Stay current on industry trends (particularly materials) and be ready to be informed enough to invent.  
5.  Become digitally savvy (CAD, Adobe, Computational design, FEA)

## Amy Tang: TT Alumni
1. Worked Johnson & Johnson Co-op (30 hrs/week) while taking two mechE classes and being PI at the same time. 
  - Didn't know what to expect, 1st internship taught her about what engineering was really like 
  - **Not knowing everything is okay and it's good to ask questions** 
2. Interviewing Skills: 
  - Going to workplace as engineer most people know you have the academia background 
  - Interview is your personality-presenting the best projection of yourself 
  - HR pepole don't have engineering background, based on experience/personality based questions 
  - Important to show you're a normal human being and can work in team settings 
3. Job Experience 
  - SSL, more design based, couldn't see herself working there for an extended time 
  - Lockheed Martin, more project based/meeting with managers 
4. Pursuing master's degree while working at Lockheed Martin 
  - Management Master's Degree online 
  - Companies offering master’s degree while working, easier to do right after college 
5. College
  - Doesn’t miss school, but misses being able to see friends everyday at anytime of the day 
  - Regrets: joining one of the design teams, other design teams, other extracurriculars besides TT 
6. Having a connection of people 
  - Found lockheed martin job through mutual connection, 

## Bryan Zhao: NASA, UC Davis Student
1. Emphasis on how own self-work and personal projects is more valuable than joining organizations on campus. 
 	- BCNC 
    - Morgan Stanley Financial Training Internship (Didn’t need these orgs to learn financial tips and tricks)
2. Enjoys doing research 
	- Worked with Dr. Harry Chang (Biomechanics Research)
	- Robotics Club
4. Portfolio of projects 
    - Designing and playing around with Solidworks 
    - Arduino Kits 
    - 20-25 hours on a boeing 747 frame
5. Religion and Engineering 
	- 75% DCF and giving back to community 
	- 25% engineering (understanding how to work the system)

## [Mary Serafin: Interviewing Tactics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlserafin) <br>
* Who Am I: Purpose Driven, Soulful, Uplifted, Curious, Relaxed
  - Who I am as a person to why I'm interviewing now 
* **Hone in on first Impression**
* Beginning, Middle, and End 
  - First came to UC Davis not entirely sure what to do, after joining different organizations, found I was most passionate about mechanical engineering (industrial design/mechatronics)
