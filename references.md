### Interviewing Tactics: 
* Who Am I: Purpose Driven, Soulful
  - Who I am as a person to why I'm interviewing now
* **Hone in on first Impression**
* Beginning, Middle, and End 
  - First came to UC Davis not entirely sure what to do, after joining different organizations, found I was most passionate about mechanical engineering (industrial design/mechatronics)
