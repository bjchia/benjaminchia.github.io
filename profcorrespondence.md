### [Networking with Recruiters](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-network-recruiter-margaret-buj)

1)  Say Hello (kind of shocking that needs to be said)
2)  Don't write "Hi Steve" and wait for me to respond as if we're in a chat room.
3)  Message should be four sentences max...not multiple paragraphs or whole resumes.  Sentence 1:  Greeting and personal reference.  Sentences 2 and 3:  Highlight of relevant experience/skills (also helpful to reference a particular job opening).  Sentence 4:  The Ask and closing.

Ask for one thing:   "Can I send you my resume for review via email?"

1)  Easy for Recruiter to quickly respond with their email address.
2)  Resume can easily be forwarded and shared with other Recruiters.
3)  Resume should be loaded into company's tracking system and tagged for future reference.
