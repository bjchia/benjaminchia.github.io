### Elon Musk & Larry Page 

> Larry Page: "I don't we're doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do. I think we're just not educating people in this kind of general way. You should have a pretty broad engineering and scientific background. You should have some leaderhsip training and a bit of MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and raise money. I don't think most people are doing that, and it's a big problem. Engineers are usually trained in a very fixed area. When you're able to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind of think differently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work. That's how we make progress.""

* Musk realized he could tap into their stores of knowledge. He would trap an engineer in the SpaceX factory and set to work grilling him about a type of valve or specialized material. “I thought at first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff,” said Kevin Brogan, one of the early engineers. “Then I realized he was trying to learn things. He would quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you know.” **People who have spent significant time with Musk will attest to his abilities to absorb incredible quantities of information with near-flawless recall.** It’s one of his most impressive and intimidating skills and seems to work just as well in the present day as it did when he was a **child vacuuming books into his brain.**

* Always moving forward. 

### Steve Jobs 

* He emphasized that you should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last.” 

* Apple Marketing Philosophy 
	- The first was empathy, an intimate connection with the feelings of the customer: “We will truly understand their needs better than any other company.” The second was focus: “In order to do a good job of those things that we decide to do, we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.” The third and equally important principle, awkwardly named, was impute. It emphasized that people form an opinion about a company or product based on the signals that it conveys. “People DO judge a book by its cover,” he wrote. “We may have the best product, the highest quality, the most useful software etc.; if we present them in a slipshod manner, they will be perceived as slipshod; if we present them in a creative, professional manner, we will impute the desired qualities.” 

* Job's Design Philosophy: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” 

* There is something indefinable in an entrepreneur, and I saw that in Steve,” he said. “He was interested not just in engineering, but also the business aspects. I taught him that if you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him, ‘Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.’”

* Steve Jobs would audit classes at Stanford.

* On the topic of customer research: "No, because customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.”

* If they knew what they were talking about, he would tolerate the pushback, even admire it...If they turned out to be right, he would appreciate their renegade attitude and willingness to ignore authority. After all, that’s what he did.

* The theory, shared by many, is that the tough love made him wiser and more mature. But it’s not that simple. At the company he founded after being ousted from Apple, Jobs was able to indulge all of his instincts, both good and bad. He was unbound. The result was a series of spectacular products that were dazzling market flops. This was the true learning experience. **What prepared him for the great success he would have in Act III was not his ouster from his Act I at Apple but his brilliant failures in Act II.** 

* “Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do,” he said. “That’s true for companies, and it’s true for products.” 

* One of the first things Jobs did during the product review process was ban PowerPoints. “I hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking,” Jobs later recalled. “People would confront a problem by creating a presentation. I wanted them to engage, to hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they’re talking about don’t need PowerPoint.” 


## Warren Buffett 

* Concept of Inner Scorecard
	- If you know why you're doing what you're doing, that's good enough
	- Don't need to validate to other people 

* Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they're too heavy to be broken

* Warren is brutal in appraising his past. He wants to identify misthinkings and avoid them in the future. 

## Kobe Bryant 

* Breaks everything down into the smallest details to thoroughly understand it

* His mentality matches a lot of entrepreneurial great’s (Elon, Buffett)

* Taking his approach in training, footwork, dedication to basketball and seeing how it applies to life (business, PD)

## Mark Rober 

* Kids are always looking and questioning and making observations about the world around them 

* The most creative people are those who are able to maintain that kid-like approach/view of the world 

* The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas but escaping from old ones. 

* Go out and keep practicing things repetitively. Multiple and hundreds of prototypes before one working 

* Here are a few things that come to mind: Seeking out people who know what they're talking about on a particular matter.  Google.  Listening to a couple books a month, mostly non-fiction.

## Leonardo Da Vinci 

* “Ideas are often generated in physical gathering places where people with diverse interests encounter one another serendipitously. That is why Steve Jobs liked his buildings to have a central atrium and why the young Benjamin Franklin founded a club where the most interesting people of Philadelphia would gather every Friday. At the court of Ludovico Sforza, Leonardo found friends who could spark new ideas by rubbing together their diverse passions.”

* “Visualization and drawing became an important component of this process. Not comfortable wrestling with theory, he preferred dealing with knowledge that he could observe and draw.”

* “Deep observation must be done in steps: “If you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects, begin with the details of them, and do not go on to the second step until you have the first well fixed in memory.”
