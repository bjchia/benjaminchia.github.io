### Elon Musk & Larry Page 

> Larry Page 
>> I don't we're doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do. I think we're just not educating people in this kind of general way. You should have a pretty broad engineering and scientific background. You should have some leaderhsip training and a bit of MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and raise money. I don't think most people are doing that, and it's a big problem. Engineers are usually trained in a very fixed area. When you're able to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind of think differently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work. That's how we make progress.

* Musk realized he could tap into their stores of knowledge. He would trap an engineer in the SpaceX factory and set to work grilling him about a type of valve or specialized material. “I thought at first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff,” said Kevin Brogan, one of the early engineers. “Then I realized he was trying to learn things. He would quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you know.” **People who have spent significant time with Musk will attest to his abilities to absorb incredible quantities of information with near-flawless recall.** It’s one of his most impressive and intimidating skills and seems to work just as well in the present day as it did when he was a **child vacuuming books into his brain.**

### Steve Jobs 

* He emphasized that you should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last.” 

* Apple Marketing Philosophy 
	- The first was empathy, an intimate connection with the feelings of the customer: “We will truly understand their needs better than any other company.” The second was focus: “In order to do a good job of those things that we decide to do, we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.” The third and equally important principle, awkwardly named, was impute. It emphasized that people form an opinion about a company or product based on the signals that it conveys. “People DO judge a book by its cover,” he wrote. “We may have the best product, the highest quality, the most useful software etc.; if we present them in a slipshod manner, they will be perceived as slipshod; if we present them in a creative, professional manner, we will impute the desired qualities.” 

* Job's Design Philosophy: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” 

* There is something indefinable in an entrepreneur, and I saw that in Steve,” he said. “He was interested not just in engineering, but also the business aspects. I taught him that if you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him, ‘Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.’”

* Steve Jobs would audit classes at Stanford.

* On the topic of customer research: "No, because customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.”

* If they knew what they were talking about, he would tolerate the pushback, even admire it. By 1983 those most familiar with his reality distortion field had discovered something further: They could, if necessary, just quietly disregard what he decreed. If they turned out to be right, he would appreciate their renegade attitude and willingness to ignore authority. After all, that’s what he did. 

## Warren Buffett 

* Concept of Inner Scorecard
	- If you know why you're doing what you're doing, that's good enough
	- Don't need to validate to other people 

* Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they're too heavy to be broken

* Warren is brutal in appraising his past. He wants to identify misthinkings and avoid them in the future.
