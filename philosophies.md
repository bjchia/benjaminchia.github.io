### Elon Musk & Larry Page 

> Larry Page 
>> I don't we're doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do. I think we're just not educating people in this kind of general way. You should have a pretty broad engineering and scientific background. You should have some leaderhsip training and a bit of MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and raise money. I don't think most people are doing that, and it's a big problem. Engineers are usually trained in a very fixed area. When you're able to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind of think differently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work. That's how we make progress.

### Steve Jobs 

* He emphasized that you should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last.” 

* Apple Marketing Philosophy 
	- The first was empathy, an intimate connection with the feelings of the customer: “We will truly understand their needs better than any other company.” The second was focus: “In order to do a good job of those things that we decide to do, we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.” The third and equally important principle, awkwardly named, was impute. It emphasized that people form an opinion about a company or product based on the signals that it conveys. “People DO judge a book by its cover,” he wrote. “We may have the best product, the highest quality, the most useful software etc.; if we present them in a slipshod manner, they will be perceived as slipshod; if we present them in a creative, professional manner, we will impute the desired qualities.” 

* Job's Design Philosophy: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”
