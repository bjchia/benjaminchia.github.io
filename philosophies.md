### Elon Musk & Larry Page 

> Larry Page 
>> I don't we're doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do. I think we're just not educating people in this kind of general way. You should have a pretty broad engineering and scientific background. You should have some leaderhsip training and a bit of MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and raise money. I don't think most people are doing that, and it's a big problem. Engineers are usually trained in a very fixed area. When you're able to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind of think differently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work. That's how we make progress.
